ADD: pft.M0040: information: The following 2 pin(s) will be assigned a location by the fitter: \CapSense:CmodCH0(0)\, \CapSense:PortCH0(0)\
Info: mpr.M0037: Unused pieces of the design have been optimized out. See the Tech mapping section of the report file for details. (App=cydsfit)

Log: plm.M0038: The pin named Pin_servo(0) at location P12[2] prevents usage of special purposes: SIO. (App=cydsfit)
Log: plm.M0038: The pin named testcounter(0) at location P12[3] prevents usage of special purposes: SIO. (App=cydsfit)
Info: plm.M0037: Car.rpt: 
      Certain internal analog resources use the following pins for preferred routing: P12[2], P12[3].
      Please check the "Final Placement Details" section of the report file (Car.rpt) to see what resources are impacted by your pin selections.
